# Audio recorder

This is a simple audio recorder. It does 3 things:
- *record from browser* when you hit record and then *stop*
- *replay your audio* when you play the audio
- *upload to Google Drive* if you previously connected your GG drive account

Just run `npx serve` in the main folder and open your browser
